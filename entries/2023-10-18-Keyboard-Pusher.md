#Keyboard Pusher

##2023-10-18

I read something cool the other day - when you start a business you don't marry the solution, you marry the problem.

While running your business you will gather feedback, pivot, and change almost everything in your business. But the problem your business will solve will most likely stay the same.

So always think about the problem. Is this the problem I want to spend my energy and time on?

I always wanted to have a business of my own. However, I have yet to find my problem.

From what I read and saw, some people just fool around after hours and stumble upon their problem. Others think of a problem they would like to solve and change their lives to do so.

I'm more of a former kind, but I don't fool around as much as I would like to. I watch YouTube and read Medium too much. I have a little bit of a problem with motivation.

Oh! I just got an idea. I read somewhere that you should figure out something you would like to improve about yourself, come up with a KPI, and just measure it. Establish a minimum threshold and go over it every day.

My KPI can be the number of keyboard presses after 5 PM!

If I'm watching YouTube I'm hardly pressing any keys.

If I'm programming or writing anything it will bump up the KPI!

Brilliant!

Now I have to just find a nice tool, or create one myself to measure keypresses between 5 PM and 8 AM.
