# journal

This repo will act as my journal. I will write some stuff here I think is cool.

I read something cool the other day - when you start a business you don't marry the solution, you marry the problem.

While running your business you will gather feedback, pivot and change almost everything in your business. But the problem your business will solve will most likely stay the same.

So always think about the problem. Is this the problem I want to spend my effort solving?
